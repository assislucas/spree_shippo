Shippo Spree Extension
=================

The Shippo Spree extensions connects a Spree store with Shippo. Shippo will import all orders via the Spree API, allowing you to obtain shipping labels for your shipping carriers on goshippo.com. Supported carriers include USPS, UPS, FedEx, DHL Express, Canada Post and many others. 

The extension will autoamtically create a new Spree user that you need to enter for your Shippo account. The setup is easy:

1. Create a free Shippo account at https://goshippo.com.
2. Enter your Spree's Shippo user API token in the Shippo Spree settings.

Your orders will then be imported automatically. Every shipping label you purchase on Shippo will set the Spree order automatically to "Shipped" and add the tracking number.

Installation
------------

Add spree_shippo_labels to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_shippo_labels'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_shippo_labels:install
```

Configuration
------------

The Shippo extension allows chosen partners to automate the signup flow of Spree users. To obtain the required shippo_partner_key and shippo_partner_secret, please contact Shippo at support@goshippo.com. For individual stores, the configuration variables can be ignored.


Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_shippo_labels/factories'
```
